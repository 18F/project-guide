## Start a README

Start building a project document right away. Your README should capture the most important information from your conversations with the business unit, your team, and other key players, but you should try to keep it short and evergreen. This will simplify the onboarding process and serve as a valuable reference for your team.

Your README could include:

- Project description and vision
- The cascading strategy: How does your project fit into your partner's and our organizational mission and goals from TTS down to your project?
- Background info: Do some initial research into your partner agency and the laws and regulations that affect your project. Wikipedia and Vox are great starting places.
- The [tock](http://tock.18f.gov) code to bill your time
- Common jargon and acronyms
- Links to your tools, like your github repos, a notes document, business documents like your SOW, your Google Drive folder

Some project README examples include:

- [FOIA project README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aUOGzGTc5vSFwt0rw0nFa0TnOszuvEqib0Vakz39mgs/edit#heading=h.2lif1o1y3cha)
- [Alaska medicaid project's README](https://github.com/18F/acq-alaska-dhss-modernization)

## Meet with your business unit

- Ask your business unit who will be responsible for managing your budget, travel, contract issues, and more. If you're working with the Custom Partner Solutions (CPS) business unit, they manage this centrally.
- Review any intake documentation from your business unit's initial project reviews or scoping conversations.
- Review the IAA/SOW. This is our contract with your partner agency, so you should be very familiar with it. However, keep in mind that relying on a contract to resolve a problem or disagreement is a worst case scenario. Then, ask your business unit what isn't on paper. Contracts are always a negotiation between us, your partner, and everyone's lawyers. Was anything contentious or removed? Who was involved on the partner agency's side?
- Ask why we decided to take on this project and if there is anyone else at TTS who might have valuable insight on the project or partner agency.
- Discuss possible red flags.

## Meet your team

Hold an initial kickoff meeting with your team to discuss:

- Names, preferred pronouns, locations, and timezones
- Where to find your project's documents, especially the README
- Why folks are interested in this project and any concerns or questions they might have
- Clarify everyone's roles and what that means to them. What are their primary skills? What do they find challenging or stressful? Depending on their expertise and the size of your team, working with the chapters to identify leads for design and engineering is a good practice.
- Summarize anything important from your meeting with the business unit
- The tock line for billing time, how many hours everyone is expected to bill per week, and what to do if that needs to change
- Whom to notify about additional expenses (for example, cloud.gov quota increases, travel, or help from people outside of the team)
- Expectations of availability and response times
- Ensure everyone's emergency contact information is up to date.

Discuss everyone's participation in research. We have found that projects are much more successful when all team members (including engineers) are involved in discovery research, brainstorming, and usability testing. Building a cross-functional team with a shared understanding of the problem space is crucial to good decision making, brainstorming, and innovation. It is also a core tenet of agile development.

As an example, engineers need to make more decisions in development than designers can (or should) prescribe. Making good decisions is easier when the whole team has a shared understanding of the users and the problem space.

## Meet with your partner agency

Some initial points of discussion that we recommend include:

- Thank the partner agency for hiring us.
- Check in on their feelings toward us at this point. The IAA process can be difficult and stressful. Are they frustrated? Excited? Behind schedule?
- Do you need special access to their systems, buildings, and so on?
- Who approves travel? Where do you send invoices?
- Ask them about the SOW, and what's in it and what's not (similar to the discussion with your business unit).
- Schedule a regular check in between you and your partner (many PMs schedule a weekly or biweekly meeting). This is an effective way to discuss progress, prioritize goals, request help with blockers, answer questions and explain jargon (on both sides), and, most importantly, catch issues and anxieties before they become real problems.
- Encourage your partner to participate in design research and usability testing -- and ask that they invite any skeptics as well. This can be very powerful and convincing when discrepancies eventually arise between stakeholder and user needs.
- Request read aheads about the agency or project, their org chart, bureaucracy to expect, special challenges and interoffice politics, and more. Sometimes, these are helpful and important because they'll allow the team to accomplish more and take better advantage of the time they're physically present for the workshops. Sometimes, this content doesn't make sense without an explanation from your partner, and spending a lot of time reading through obscure/jargony docs isn't a good use of your team's time. You'll have to play it by ear.
- Discuss timelines and when you should fly the team in town for a kick off meeting. Ask them if they would be willing to provide introductory lessons about the project and agency.
