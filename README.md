## 18F Project Guide

This guide was developed for 18F employees, but we hope itâ€™s a useful reference for anyone.

### Running the site

The 18F Content Guide runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To run it locally:

1. Make sure that you have Ruby 2.3. At present, this project is incompatible with Ruby 2.4.
1. Clone the repository.
1. Get [Jekyll][] and the necessary dependencies: `bundle install`
1. Run the web server with `./go serve` (or `jekyll serve` if you have Jekyll installed globally)
1. Visit the local site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Note that you will also need [Node.js][] in order for the site's built-in
search functionality to work. If you don't have it, that's ok--the search
functionality won't work for you, though.

### Running the site with Docker

If you don't want to have to deal with making sure that you have the
proper version of Ruby and Node installed, you can use Docker instead. It
takes care of all the dependencies for you.

1. Install [Docker Community Edition][].
1. Clone the repository.
1. Run `docker-compose up`.
1. Visit the local site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you ever decide that you no longer want to use Docker, run
`docker-compose down -v` to properly clean everything up.
