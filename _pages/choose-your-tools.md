title: Choose your tools
---
As a team, agreeing early about team processes, communication styles, and meetings will improve your workflow and help prevent common miscommunications.

Importantly, many teams have found that including your partner agency in as many of these processes and meetings as feasible helps build crucial understanding and trust. However, you may also find that technical and jargon-heavy meetings, for example, are not the best use of your partners' time. Instead, a short daily stand up might be sufficient. Finding the right balance is often an evolving process, and retros are one of the best ways to find that right balance. Most importantly, frequent communication is incredibly valuable for building relationships and trust as well as removing blockers for your team.

While choosing processes and tools, consider these questions for your partner:

- Can they access our tools? (For example, GSA only allows the use software listed in its [IT Standards List](https://ea.gsa.gov/EAWEB/#!/itstandards).)
- Discuss Slack, GitHub, and video chat. Offer training. If your partner can use these tools, your life will be much easier (and your teams' relationship better). (The 18F Handbook has guidance on [inviting partners to Slack](https://handbook.18f.gov/slack/#external-collaborators).)
- What is their availability? Share yours.
- Share the best way to reach each other if it's urgent.

Another crucial principle to keep in mind when making these decisions is our core value of "default to open."" Sharing code and drafts with as many people as possible as early as possible significantly reduces surprises and builds trust and understanding. Discomfort with imperfection is **not** a sufficient reason for private repos in this organization. Learn more about our [open source policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/).
