title: What to cover: Share
---
First, you'll introduce your team and what to expect from us. Kick off your project by showing that you are a team of experts and professionals. This is helpful to start building trust with your partners, which is crucial to your project's success. One way to do this is with a presentation:

- Address concerns that you've heard your partner might have
- Reinforce our core values
- Explain what they should expect: high level next steps, major milestones, and day-to-day communication
- Discuss questions

This is also an important opportunity to provide your partner agency with training and intro guides (such as the [18F method cards](https://methods.18f.gov/)). You need them to be your advocate, and this will help them significantly. Sometimes it even helps to ask the question bluntly: We know working with us is different â€” how can we help? Talking points, documents, etc? How can we help give you air cover and support you so you can provide us air cover? Bringing in a different or new consultant (that's you) almost always means that someone inside the building took a big risk and vouched for us.

We do not currently have official presentations, but we do have some great templates and resources to help you with this:

- [High level recommendations from the Strategy team for a good presentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwWADPsr_rDlHRaga7mFwY-F4vvrU8dfcmL9Sbbd364/edit)
- [FOIA kickoff presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1feOiYtK5RoJ0UqxUsrP5EGdKIfDCLw8oQInDtcaO9EY/edit#slide=id.g2216787283_0_263) and the [Crime Data Explorer kickoff presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WnCWmLFPKKPgwLeAmyhfOkijjqCitHleUksa-LnnF_M/edit#slide=id.g167459c3ce_0_198)
- Contact info is good to reiterate at the end. In addition, make sure you include contact info for an [escalation path](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YZEPclmldzhEZavmHxXoZrVYbPlj9fIPehif_MBAncU/edit#slide=id.g1d29fe035e_7_106).
- Your business unit might have some templates they prefer.
- For reinforcing our values, the content in the [18F Partnership Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/partnership-playbook/) and the [18F guides](https://guides.18f.gov/) are useful.

Some additional topics you should review include:

- User-centered design and how we pivot or recommend against building features if we find that the users need something different.
- How your agile process will work. Theoretically agreeing to use agile and user-centered design and actually doing them can differ significantly. People often expect us to use the same methodologies and approaches that they have been using, just magically better. Agile often requires a giant leap of faith, because government traditionally mitigates risk through extensive planning and documentation before starting a project.
- Iterative releases and betas. Traditionally, government organizations wait to release projects until they are finished and perfect, usually with a big, splashy launch. This, of course, is not agile or lean. Discuss this with your partner early, and why releasing betas early and often is important to mitigating risk. The public is usually more understanding of imperfect betas if you are transparent about their limitations than agencies expect.
