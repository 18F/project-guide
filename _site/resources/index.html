          <h2 id="discovery-research">Discovery research</h2>
<p>After kicking off your project, your team will get started on discovery research. As described above, including your whole team in the research and user interviews is best practice. If you have questions about design next steps, reach out to the design team or review the design wiki.
- The <a href="https://lean-product-design.18f.gov/">lean product design guide</a> is an excellent next step to follow this guide. Check the other <a href="https://guides.18f.gov/">18F guides</a> for help as well.
- Write your weekly ship! Writing a weekly summary is strongly encouraged. We recommend this communication device based on comprehensive research into what makes our projects successful. One approach is to gather a list of bullet points in a Friday meeting with your team; reviewing the week’s accomplishments can be a powerfully positive exercise for the team. <a href="https://gsa-tts.slack.com/files/mcata/F4S931TV3/Weekly_Ship_Origin_Story">Learn more about the weekly ship here.</a>
- After about 3-4 weeks of discovery research, you might want to bring everyone back in town to share your research and findings with your partner. Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13oA2asT5taAUHHX2tmXV0IteeEv4bj_2Jb52kBCJc0o/edit#slide=id.g167459c3ce_0_198">sample briefing</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ending-and-transitioning-your-project">Ending and transitioning your project</h2>
<p>The following are guides and resources for finishing your project, but you should familiarize yourself with them at the beginning of your project.
- Our <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship">Before You Ship</a> guide is actually full of VERY IMPORTANT issues to understand at the beginning of your project (because they will ultimately affect your launch and the commitments you can make). Pay special attention to the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/ato/">section about ATOs</a>. You cannot launch a project – or even discuss potential launch dates with your partner – before you have an ATO.
- Similarly, you should review the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1na5DwG7GVBFh14C8lTK3cK-_j982hmZhtKpRUh4AcHE/edit#">transition guide</a> at the beginning of the project.
- Once your team is building and releasing features – usually after an initial discovery phase – you will also need to incorporate feature testing in your sprint cycle.
  - Users: Testing with users at least once per sprint is a best practice. The FEC team developed a graphic to explain how they manage this.
  - Partners: Often, teams push updates to a staging server so their partner can review, test, approve them before public release. If you keep <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/01/17/life-changing-magic-writing-release-notes/">release notes</a>, these can be used as a checklist for feature testing.
  - This is <a href="https://github.com/18F/fec-testing/blob/master/FEC-testing-process.png">an illustrated guide</a> to the FEC team’s sprint, testing, and release cycle.</p>

  <li>Open source code reviews: Each project team at 18F treats code review a little differently but documents it in a Team Practices document or a Contributing document. What all 18F teams have in common is that they use Github’s Pull Request and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/">code review tools</a> to facilitate code reviews.
