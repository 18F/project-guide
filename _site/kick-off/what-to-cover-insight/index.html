          <h2>What to Cover - Gaining Insight</h2>
          <p>In the workshop, you’ll need to align expectations and begin to understand the users and the problem. Why are we here? Why is this project worth doing? Your designers will usually lead this, but here are some topics you should make sure to cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are the users? How will you recruit them for research and testing?</li>
  <li>What’s wrong with the status quo? Why is it this way? How are users currently solving this problem?</li>
  <li>How big is the problem? What size bite do they want to take out of it initially? The smaller the better.</li>
  <li>What’s in scope? What’s out of scope?</li>
  <li>What is the higher level vision and mission? One way to explore this is to ask what success would look like in 100 years, 15 years, and 5 years.</li>
  <li>Examine their assumptions and ask a lot of questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, conducting exercises to align on expectations and potential problems are important. For each of these exercises, encourage folks to write their ideas on post-it notes for a few minutes, and then share them, clustering similar ideas. You may need to ask people to only share their most important ideas, depending on the number of attendees and time. Then, hold a discussion about major patterns and themes. This approach helps ensure contributions from everyone are heard, instead of a vocal minority.</p>

<p><strong>Hopes and fears:</strong> This can help dispel fear, uncertainty, and doubt, as well as meaningfully breaking the ice. Ask everyone to write down their hopes for the project on post-its, then their fears.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-mortem:</strong> This helps surface potential pitfalls or risks the team should know about. Ask everyone to imagine the project is completed and it failed, and then write down reasons it failed on post-its.</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> Best to end on a high note! This exercise helps surface priorities, and it’s especially useful for identifying any discrepancies between partners. Ask everyone to write down the one, most important thing that needs to happen to make the project a success.</p>
